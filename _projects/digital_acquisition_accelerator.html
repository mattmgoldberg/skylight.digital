{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    As part of the White House's Office of Management and Budget's Acquisition
    Innovation Labs initiative, the Digital Acquisition Accelerator was a pilot training program
    designed to accelerate the development of digital acquisition experts across the government.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The modern delivery of information technology, including human-centered design,
    lean-agile development, open-source software, and cloud computing, all represent
    fundamentally new ways of procuring products and services from the vendor community.
    But how do you induce the necessary institutional changes at the scale of government?
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, Chris Cairns and Shashank Khandelwal architected and
    led a "train-the-trainer" program designed to help agencies establish their own
    multidisciplinary team of digital acquisition experts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The program brought together expert trainers and coaches
    from 18F, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, and the U.S. Digital Service
    (the first-ever such cross-organizational collaboration) who worked with agencies
    to assemble their teams and build-up their expertise through a variety of development
    techniques, including classroom training, hands-on learning (involving
    real-world acquisitions), and knowledge capture and sharing.
