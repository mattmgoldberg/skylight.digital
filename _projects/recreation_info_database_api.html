{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    When the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Recreation.gov
    contract came up for rebid, the request for proposal (RFP) had insufficient
    language regarding an API for accessing the website's data layer,
    called the Recreation Information Database (RIDB). Without a good API in place,
    the Recreation.gov website would be the only source for browsing national
    park information from RIDB, thus limiting the potential for mobile and other
    forward-thinking types of applications. Proposing the right language helped
    reduce the USDA's risk of procuring the wrong solution.

    The <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=3c740c1e5b809e5ecd99a4cf8a0467b3&tab=core&_cview=0">Recreation.gov RFP</a>
    was going to close in two weeks. To align this effort with its
    <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/">Open Data Policy</a>,
    the White House sought urgent advice on how to make the RFP more API focused so that the next
    generation of Recreation.gov could not only serve mobile users, but also foster future
    innovation via an external API developer community.

  <p>
    Working as an API evangelist, Kin Lane answered the White House's
    call-to-civic-action by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">proposing critical language changes to the RFP</a>
    to ensure that vendor proposals reflected an API-based solution approach
    using best practices such as RESTful API design, supporting documentation,
    and software development kits (or SDKs).
  </p>

  <p>
    Following the rework and release of the RFP, Kin engaged even further in
    helping to make the RIDB API a success by building a user and
    developer community around it, as well as collaborating with industry
    and government to explore <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">innovative economic models for monetizing access to national park data</a>.
