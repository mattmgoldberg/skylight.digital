{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Veterans Affairs' (VA's) API Platform Management team needed insight
    into current best practices for API governance. So we delivered a
    comprehensive research report that drew on a combination of our own
    expertise and information gathered from interviewing leading organizations.

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    In preparation for gearing up the number of APIs delivered across the
    enterprise, the VA's API Platform Management team needed to better
    understand best practices for governing APIs, particularly given the
    lack of formal research in this area.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, we conducted a research process that involved:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Mining information related to API governance from our decade's worth of
      existing primary and secondary research, which amounts to over 3,000
      API-related articles
    </li>

    <li>
      Augmenting this research by interviewing key people responsible for
      API governance at a diverse number of public- and private-sector organizations
    </li>

    <li>
      Analyzing and synthesizing our research information into a comprehensive
      report on API governance best practices, covering topic areas such as
      organizational models and standards
    </li>
  </ul>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Delivered the project under the federal procurement micropurchase threshold of $10,000
    </li>

    <li>
      Interviewed seven different organizations, including the Government Digital
      Service (UK), HM Revenue & Customs (UK), Capital One, and more
    </li>

    <li>
      Published the report in the open and with no copyright, making it free to anyone
      who wants to learn from and reuse the content
    </li>
  </ul>
