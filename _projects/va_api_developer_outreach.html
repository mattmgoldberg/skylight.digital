{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Veterans Affairs' (VA's) API Platform Management team wanted to increase
    adoption of their APIs. We delivered them a comprehensive research report
    on how to accomplish that, based on a combination of our own expertise and
    information gathered from interviewing leading organizations.
  </p>

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Recognizing that simply making datasets and APIs available doesn't guarantee
    success, the VA wanted to expand the adoption of their APIs. They needed
    insight into how to build and sustain an effective developer outreach program.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, we conducted a research process that involved:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Mining information related to API developer outreach from our decade's worth of
      existing primary and secondary research, which amounts to over 3,000 API-related articles
    </li>

    <li>
      Augmenting this research by interviewing key people responsible for API developer
      outreach at a diverse number of public- and private-sector organizations
    </li>

    <li>
      Analyzing and synthesizing our research information into a comprehensive report on
      API developer outreach best practices, covering topic areas such as funnel metrics
      and developer sandbox environments
    </li>
  </ul>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Delivered the project under the federal procurement micropurchase threshold of $10,000
    </li>

    <li>
      Interviewed seven different organizations, including the Centers for
      Medicare & Medicaid Services' Blue Button API program, the Census Bureau,
      OpenFEC, and more
    </li>

    <li>
      Published the report in the open and with no copyright, making it free to anyone
      who wants to learn from and reuse the content
    </li>
  </ul>
