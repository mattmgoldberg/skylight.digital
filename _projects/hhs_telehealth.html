{% capture summary %}
  <p>   
    Under the nationwide COVID-19 emergency declaration, telehealth plays a significant 
    role in the nation’s healthcare system, allowing patients to access medical care from home. 

    New and rapidly evolving policies during the crisis expedited telehealth coverage and 
    availability, along with the need for information about how to provide or use it. 

    Our team worked with the Human Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), 
    and partners across the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to 
    translate the latest guidelines and best practices into plain-language content for 
    both provider and patient audiences.

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The pandemic has created an unprecedented strain on the country’s medical system. 

    Telehealth, medical care that doesn’t require in-person contact between medical workers 
    and patients, can protect healthcare providers and the public from unnecessary exposure 
    to disease. Remote healthcare is a convenient option for many people even under ordinary 
    circumstances, but it’s an especially important tool during a public health crisis. 

    New government policies and flexibilities broaden how telehealth is delivered and what’s 
    covered during the emergency period, but the information about these quickly-evolving 
    options isn’t always easy to find or understand. 

    The urgent need to disseminate information during the public health emergency necessitated 
    an unusually tight timeline for launching this work; our challenge was to quickly 
    centralize the most relevant information so that providers and the public could 
    understand whether telehealth meets their needs and how to take advantage of it.

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    Our team quickly moved from concept to working code. In just a few weeks, we launched 
    <a href="https://telehealth.hhs.gov/">Telehealth.HHS.gov</a> — a website to help medical 
    providers and the public (“patients”) navigate telehealth options in the midst of a peaking pandemic. 
    
    Luckily, we weren’t starting <i>completely</i> from scratch: we leveraged robust open-source tools 
    (such as the U.S. Web Design System), proven digital delivery best practices like user-centered 
    design, and our team’s combined years of experience launching public digital services (and maybe 
    a bit of adrenaline!). 

    To reach this solution we:

     <ul>
         <li>Interviewed physicians and members of the public (people who might use 
             telehealth as patients) to understand their familiarity with telehealth, 
             where they go for information today, and potential barriers to providing 
             or using telehealth
         </li>
         
         <li>Prioritized content, validated early prototypes, and defined an initial 
             product direction in line with business needs
        </li>
        
        <li>Consulted subject-matter experts for feedback and content reviews
        </li>

        <li>Ran moderated and unmoderated user research studies to further 
            validate and iterate on designs and content as we approached launch day
        </li>
        
        <li>Drafted a content guide alongside the product itself to make sure we 
            held ourselves to high-quality content standards, even at our rapid 
            pace (and to guide future content development)
        </li>
    </ul>  

    Following the initial launch, we’ve since revised and released new content, such as:

    <ul>
       <li>Best practice guides for providers, on specialized topic areas such as 
           telehealth in emergency departments and direct-to-consumer telehealth
       </li>

       <li>Tips for finding free or low-cost telehealth services through a health center
       </li>

       <li>Medicare policy and billing updates
       </li>    
    
       <li>How to improve telehealth access, equity, and accessibility  
       </li>
    <ul>
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
   <ul>
     <li>
        Designed and built the first iteration of Telehealth.HHS.gov within a few weeks
     </li>

    <li>
        Held interviews and unmoderated research studies with over 75 participants ahead of the first launch
    </li>

    <li>
        Laid the foundation to expand this work in partnership with HRSA
    </li>

    <li>
        Reached over 375,000 people across the country since launch
    </li>

    <li>
        75% of all responses to “Is this page useful?” survey have been “yes” 
    </li>
  </ul>
