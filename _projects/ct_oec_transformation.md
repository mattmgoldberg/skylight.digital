{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Connecticut Office of Early Childhood (OEC) is embarking on a journey
    to change how they use technology in support of young children and their
    families throughout the state of Connecticut. We were brought in
    to help them achieve this important goal.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    OEC is a $400M state agency that oversees a network of programs and services,
    such as child development and parenting support, that help over 200,000 young
    children and their families thrive.
  </p>

  <p>
    A key part of OEC’s work is supporting the providers, teachers, and other professionals
    who’ve dedicated their careers to caring for and educating children.
  </p>

  <p>
    OEC’s ability to successfully execute on their mission depends on the effective
    use of technology, much of which needs modernizing in order to deliver better
    user experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    In alignment with the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ecd/early-learning/preschool-development-grants">Preschool Development Grant program</a>, which is
    administered by the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/">Administration for Children and Families</a>,
    OEC sought a partner who could help them digitally transform their organization.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, we designed an approach that focuses on building
    OEC’s internal digital capacity while at the same time modernizing critical
    services. Thus far, our efforts have involved:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/work/experience/ct-oec-website-redesign/">Modernizing OEC’s web presence</a>
      to make it easier for families, childcare providers, and other users to access
      critical early-childhood resources, such as where to find high-quality childcare
      providers
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="/work/experience/ct-ece-reporter/">Creating a user-friendly data collection tool</a>
      to get accurate information from early care and education providers about the
      children in their care
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="/work/experience/ct-oec-care4kids-auto-notifier/">Rapidly piloting solutions</a>
      to better inform strategies around how to make it easier for families
      to access affordable childcare
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="/work/experience/ct-families-experiencing-homelessness/">Leveraging data and information</a>
      to better support families with young children experiencing homelessness
    </li>

    <li>
      Writing a <a href="/work/toolkits/digital-talent-management/">Digital Talent Management Handbook</a>
      that provides guidance on how the organization can build up its internal
      digital talent capacity effectively
    </li>

    <li>
      Developing a number of toolkits to help the organization adopt modern procurement,
      design, delivery, and data practices —
      <a href="/work/toolkits/agile-procurement-playbook/">Agile Procurement Playbook</a>,
      <a href="/work/toolkits/data-sharing-playbook/">Data Sharing Playbook</a>, and
      Content Guidelines
    </li>

    <li>
      Supporting the structuring, recruiting, and hiring of in-house digital service experts
    </li>

    <li>
      Training nearly 20 procurement officials in modern acquisition practices, based on our
      <a href="/work/services/training/ditap-executive/">Digital IT Acquisition Professional Training — Executive Edition</a>
      training course
    </li>

    <li>
      Helping the entire organization adapt to working in a virtual environment
      in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including setting up digital tools
      and training on remote-work best practices
    </li>
  </ul>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Launched several modernized services, including OEC’s new online presence
    </li>

    <li>
      Built up internal digital capacity through talent support, training,
      pairing, and best-practice toolkits
    </li>

    <li>
      Accelerated the adoption of modern acquisition practices
    </li>

    <li>
      Helped enable over 200 professionals to work more effectively in a virtual environment
    </li>
  </ul>
