{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Connecitcut Office of Early Childhood (OEC) engaged us to transform their
    web presence into a single, user-focused homepage with clear pathways for different
    users to access the information and resources they need.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    A well-designed digital home is critical for providing information and services
    that meet user needs and expectations. OEC had an out-of-date web presence that
    made it difficult for users to access the important resources that OEC provides
    to support young children and their families.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feedback from users made it clear that the site was hard to use and frustrating
    for the audiences that need it the most &mdash; childcare providers, families,
    and even OEC staff. Some of the most pressing issues included outdated forms,
    confusing language, and a desktop-only experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was a clear challenge for OEC in advancing its mission to support young
    children across the state.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, we engaged OEC in an agile, user-centered,
    process to support the redesign of their website. This process involved
    collaborating with dozens of OEC users and stakeholders to create a solution that:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Meets a diversity of complex user needs through extensive user research
    </li>

    <li>
      Makes it easier to search, navigate, and access critical information and resources
      &mdash; such as where to find high-quality childcare providers and how to become a
      licensed childcare provider &mdash; from a single, user-focused homepage
    </li>

    <li>
      Supports both mobile and desktop experiences
    </li>

    <li>
      Leverages cost-effective, open-source technologies
    </li>

    <li>
      Supports incremental releases of website content so value can start being
      realized sooner rather than later
    </li>

    <li>
      Is maintainable by internal staff through easy-to-use content management tools,
      content guidelines, and content design and management training
    </li>
  </ul>

{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Incrementally delivered a newly-designed, responsive website in alignment
      with user tasks, goals, and needs
    </li>

    <li>
      Fully cutover to the new site in May 2020
    </li>

    <li>
      Have continually received positive user feedback
    </li>

    <li>
      Maintainable by the Office of Early Childhood's internal staff
    </li>

    <li>
      OEC was the first State of Connecticut agency to deliver critical information
      related to COVID on its website
    </li>
  </ul>
