{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    To introduce the U.S. Navy to modern development practices and technologies, we
    implemented a mobile website in a single afternoon that mocked the functionality
    of what was really needed, allowing critical design and technology decisions to be
    made rapidly.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The U.S. Navy Reserve had a critical need to improve the digital experience of
    sailors writing orders for their reserve duties. Making this functionality accessible
    via mobile devices was a critical requirement, but whether to do this via native
    mobile apps or responsive web design remained an open question.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    Using a technique that we pioneered, called "<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/06/protosketch/" target="_blank">protosketching</a>,"
    we broke the afternoon into 3 sprints of one hour each. In this space of time, we were
    able to quickly write user stories that were acted upon by our programmers in the
    protosketching session to complete a functional mock-up in 3 hours. This allowed
    the Navy to make decisions efficiently and effectively about next steps in a major project.

  <p>Major project decisions were de-risked at relatively low cost.</p>
