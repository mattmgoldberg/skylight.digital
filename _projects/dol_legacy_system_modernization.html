{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    A Department of Labor (DOL) legacy system with a desktop-only user
    interface (UI) needed a web-based UI. By careful inspection of the code and
    experimentation, a deep "spike" solution was created that allows a small fraction
    of the system to be implemented with a web-based system utilizing in-situ business
    rules and stored procedures. This spike is the basis of planned broadening to provide
    a practical means of rewriting the entire legacy system, thus de-risking the whole project.

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The existing technology was ancient and nearly undocumented. In order to have a
    functioning spike, a complete and valid environment would have to be duplicated.
    Because the data was potentially subject to litigation and sensitive, we would have
    to work entirely with artificially created data.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    After installing a DB2 instance and extensive study of the stored procedures,
    we were able to interface to the database with a simple Python program that
    implemented a web service interface, thus allowing a simple but possibility-expanding,
    browser-based demo.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <p>
    The spike solution dramatically reshaped the DOL's acquisition plan, including
    cost estimates, by proving that an API-encapsulation approach could work and be
    expanded at minimal risk.
