{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    To further their mission of helping small businesses succeed, the Small
    Business Administration (SBA) needed a learning platform focused on
    female entrepreneurs. We've been engaged as a subcontractor to Fearless to
    deliver a technical solution that maximizes the use of an existing
    open-source-software product without limiting the flexibility needed
    to deliver a unique user experience.

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Many female entrepreneurs face significant obstacles to building their businesses,
    particularly when it comes to acquiring the outside knowledge they need to
    increase their chances of success. Determined to address this issue, the SBA
    launched Ascent, which included the creation of a new learning platform based
    on an existing open-source content management system (CMS) called Brightspot.
    The challenge has been leveraging Brightspot in such a way as to not only
    avoid constraining the design of the user experience to what's available
    "out-of-the-box," but also to avoid the nightmare of having to maintain a
    "custom-off-the-shelf-software" product.

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    As a subcontractor to <a href="https://fearless.tech/">Fearless</a>, Skylight's been
    providing additional technical leadership around how best to address this challenge.
    In particular, we've helped architect and engineer a custom API wrapper that
    programmatically makes calls into Brightspot, thereby leveraging its full feature set in
    an independent way. This approach gives them the power to create a curated learning
    experience for female entrepreneurs.

      with Brightspot, but would also provide a robust front-end development
      resource for the SBA
