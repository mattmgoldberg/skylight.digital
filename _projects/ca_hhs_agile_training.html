{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The California Health and Human Services' (CHHS') Office of Innovation
    needed help putting the principles of agile into practice. We were
    brought in to deliver a practical agile-coaching experience that not
    only tied together all the key principles of the Agile Manifesto, but also
    allowed the Office to apply these principles on a needed, real-world project.

    For some time, the CHHS Office of Innovation had been working to shift their
    technical and organizational culture toward agile principles. As an
    organization, the Office is responsible for lean design thinking and
    delivering innovative solutions to important problems. So it was
    important for the Office to not only "do" agile, but to "be" agile. But
    they were experiencing difficulty connecting the elements of agile
    together, such as planning, testing, and iteration.

    As a partner to <a href="https://civicactions.com/">CivicActions</a>,
    we helped lead a two-day intensive
    training workshop to bring every facet of agile in a personalized,
    coaching environment for the CHHS Office of Innovation. To do that,
    we simulated five sprints in a microcosm within those two days,
    focusing on applying the Scrum practices of planning, story writing,
    story estimation, velocity calcuation, and testing on the Office of
    Innovation's website, which was in need of substantial revision.
    We aimed to provide not only coaching in the Scrum framework, but also
    the energy to help participants ask the right questions about their
    agile process. In this way, we aimed to provide both an valuable
    learning experience and an improved real-world product.

      We had been training on agile for some time, and before, we understood
      all the ingredients. But this workshop brought all the ingredients
      together and showed us how to bake a cake.

      As people in the government realize the value and power of
      the agile process, it's important to understand that the
      principles of agile are key. This class teaches people how
      to get the benefits of agile without being dogmatic. My staff
      said they have been through multiple agile trainings but
      none were as valuable and practical as this. They're now
      comfortable adjusting the process to fit their needs and
      culture of the Department they're helping.
