{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Veterans Affairs needed to start preparing for how best to govern
    their growing portfolio of APIs. So we delivered them a minimum viable
    product (MVP) of an API Scorecard governance tool.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The VA recently launched an initiative called API Platform Management.
    The purpose of this new enterprise-wide program is to transform how the
    VA shares digital services through APIs. Success requires good API governance,
    so VA leaders hypothesized that creating an API Scorecard tool for use by
    teams and management could help with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Establishing a common understanding of the VA's API delivery lifecycle and
      what success looks like at each stage
    </li>

    <li>
      Enabling teams to keep management informed of status, progress, and health,
      and alert them to any issues requiring special attention
    </li>

    <li>
      Giving management visibility into how teams are doing, where they need help,
      and what governance decisions need to be made
    </li>

    <li>
      Giving stakeholders insight into the value of the VA's portfolio of APIs
    </li>

    <li>
      Reinforcing best practices among teams for delivering APIs successfully
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The VA needed a <em>lean</em> way to further flesh out and test this idea.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this need, we assembled a cross-functional team with expertise in
    UX design, software engineering, and API governance. Through a series of
    rapid iterations, we created an MVP of the API Scorecard governance tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    We used GitHub Pages to serve as a public frontend and private backend for
    the application, a <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">technique pioneered by a member of the Skylight team</a>.
    This approach avoided the additional time, cost, and complexity associated
    with setting up a secure backend server environment, thus keeping things lean.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also worked with the VA to not only define the stages of their
    API lifecycle, but also the "delivery success criteria" that governs
    how projects move from one stage to the next. We made both the stages
    and the criteria configurable from with the application's YAML files.
  </p>

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Delivered the MVP under the federal procurement micropurchase threshold of $10,000
    </li>

    <li>
      Enabled the VA to begin experimenting with how best to govern their portfolio of APIs
    </li>

    <li>
      Released all the source code in the open and with no copyright, making it
      freely available for anyone to reuse
    </li>
  </ul>
