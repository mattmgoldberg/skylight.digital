{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    Carrot is a leadership communication application that helps leaders rise above
    the noise of chat and email to keep teams alinged around what matters most.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    In the age of Slack and fast-moving conversations, the lack of
    focus and clarity have become a huge problem in the workplace.
    Email and chat apps keep everyone connected throughout the day, yet
    it's become even more difficult for teams to stay aligned around
    what's most important. The problem is that leadership is getting lost
    in all the noise.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this problem, Sean Johnson led the product development of a
    "non-chat" communication application for leaders called Carrot. Powered by
    the open source <a href="https://github.com/open-company">OpenCompany</a>
    platform, Carrot is designed to be as delightful and interactive as chat,
    but asynchronous so people can get caught up on their own time. This enables
    leaders to keep everyone focused on what matters most in order to build
    transparency, trust, and stronger teams.
