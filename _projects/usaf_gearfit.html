{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    Providing better-fitting gear to aircrew, particularly female pilots, is one of
    the U.S. Air Force's top priorities. The Human Systems Division engaged us
    to build a platform for modernizing how they manage personnel protective equipment.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    People who work for organizations in the defense, security, safety, and
    healthcare fields often experience critical issues with ill-fitting gear
    that compromise their job performance, their personal safety, and the safety
    of others. These organizations generally don't have good-enough data and systems
    in place to meet the complex protective equipment needs of their diverse workforce.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the U.S. Air Force's Human Systems Division, figuring out how to provide
    aircrew better-fitting gear is a top priority that goes all the way up to
    the <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1801680/new-direction-for-female-specific-flight-equipment/">Secretary</a>,
    and <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/new-bill-aims-to-get-better-fitting-equipment-to-women-in-the-military-1.609795">even Congress</a>.
    Female pilots in particular lack consistent access to &mdash; or, at least,
    awareness of &mdash; properly-fitting tactical gear and equipment options, exposing
    them to serious injury or mission failure.

      "In certain situations, having ill-fitting gear, such as harnesses and
      survival vests, can result in a loss of life. If an aircrew member ejects
      from the aircraft with equipment that doesn't fit, they can be severely
      injured or lose their life."
    </p>

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this complex, multi-faceted challenge, the U.S. Air Force's Human
    Systems Division engaged us to build a digital platform called GearFit.
    The current product vision for GearFit is to encompass several
    critical capabilties &mdash; such as user-driven feedback, issues reporting & analytics,
    catalog management & ordering, and training videos &mdash; for use by the entire
    aircrew population, the operational groups who support them, and potentially other
    military branches.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given the ambitious scope of this initiative, and the acute problems
    that female pilots are currently facing, we started by engaging the
    Female Fitment program managers under the Human Systems Division to build
    an application that would gather actionable and accurate equipment feedback
    from aircrew and surface it to a range of stakeholders, who can leverage and
    communicate about that data to develop high-quality insights regarding the
    successes and/or failures of personal protective equipment currently employed by
    aircrew across the Air Force. This focused effort has involved:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Designing and implementing a set of unique application interfaces
      that move data across the organization to rapidly intake aircrew feedback
    </li>

    <li>
      Expanding the depth of the data by integrating with legacy systems
    </li>

    <li>
      Presenting the data with visualization and analysis for stakeholders
      across multiple offices
    </li>

    <li>
      Incorporating the ability to directly reach back to aircrew and gain deeper
      context and provide support
    </li>

    <li>
      Initiating discussions to engage a previously disengaged user group, technicians,
      that will enhance the quality of data provided
    </li>
  </ul>
