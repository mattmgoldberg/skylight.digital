        <h2 class="mt-0 pt-3" id="introduction">Introduction to the role of product manager</h2>
<p>A product manager (PM) at Skylight is responsible for strategy, planning, execution, stakeholder management, and team health. PMs partner with user researchers, product designers, engineers, client stakeholders, and others to inform their product decisions. A PM must have a clear understanding of users’ needs, the business objectives, and the stakeholders’ vision so they can quickly make feature decisions and determine priority. At a high level, it’s the PM’s job to figure out what to build next and why.</p>

<p>Below you’ll find the full list of skills for becoming a product manager at Skylight and a description of the skills required for each level. These descriptions offer insight into the scope of work someone at each level should be capable of doing on a consistent basis.
