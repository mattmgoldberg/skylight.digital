        <h2 class="mt-0 pt-3" id="introduction">Introduction to the role of service designer</h2>
<p>Service designers tie together human, digital, and physical interactions to create service experiences that are usable, efficient, and even desirable. Service designers are expected to understand the problem and organizational landscape, identify opportunities, and iteratively develop services and solutions.</p>

<p>Service designers create or change how an organization operates in order to create or improve a service. This involves changes in processes, communication channels, organizational strategy, and technology.</p>

<p>Below you’ll find the full list of skills for becoming a service designer at Skylight and a description of the skills required at each level. These descriptions offer insight into the scope of work someone at each level should be capable of doing on a consistent basis. We use these role descriptions both as a guide during the hiring process and as a springboard for discussing career progression at Skylight.</p>

<h3 id="required-skills">Required skills</h3>

<h4 id="systems-thinking">Systems thinking</h4>

<p>You have the ability to research and then change how elements of an organization interact and influence one another. You establish a shared view of the system and reframe problems from different perspectives to uncover new solutions. You switch between the holistic and user view continuously. You know how to focus on outcomes rather than solutions and activities. You help your team do its best work by ensuring everyone has a shared sense of purpose.</p>

<h4 id="research">Research</h4>

<p>You’re able to plan, synthesize, and present research. You know that the best way to understand how a service operates is when you’re experiencing it firsthand or alongside users in their context. You have expertise in ethnographic research methods and know how to pair them with more UX- and technology-focused methodologies to gather insights that inform project direction. You accurately scope research efforts and use that research to inform project direction. You’re able to facilitate co-creative workshops to generate personas, journey maps, system maps, and service maps. You have expertise with a variety of research methods such as contextual inquiries, diary studies, and field observations.</p>

<h4 id="ideation-and-prototyping">Ideation and prototyping</h4>

<p>You use the understanding you’ve built about the big picture to help find the right problems to solve and pick the best solutions to experiment with. You gather feedback and iterate on service design work early and often. You’re familiar with different design processes such as double diamond, design thinking, and equity-centered design.</p>

<p>You can facilitate many ideation activities and create inclusive and creative spaces so that users, stakeholders, and your team can do their best work.</p>

<p>You create or design prototypes of services and applications. You use these prototypes to validate assumptions, understand restrictions, and improve interactions. You use artifacts and methods like service blueprinting, brain writing, and the business model canvas to identify opportunities and generate ideas.</p>

<h4 id="organizational-strategy">Organizational strategy</h4>

<p>You design adaptable organizations by understanding the current structure, its component parts, and the interactions between them. You know how to align policies, technology, infrastructures, and systems to drive outcomes. You’re adept at prioritizing and balancing user and business decisions.</p>

<p>You know how to work within technology, policy, regulatory, and financial constraints to propose feasible solutions.</p>

<h4 id="community-collaboration-and-communication">Community, collaboration, and communication</h4>

<p>You’re constantly seeking to meet user and project goals. You facilitate discussions to prioritize the team’s work and identify opportunities to partner with others in the organization. You lead collaborative design activities, influence others, and build consensus.</p>

<p>You know how to negotiate trade-offs when necessary. You incorporate storytelling for effective and engaging communication. You use different mapping tools to identify the right places to focus, surface insights about your stakeholders, and pick the most impactful solutions to experiment with so you can go beyond the obvious and design lasting solutions.</p>

<p>You’re able to build positive influence in project direction, stakeholder relations, and organizational leadership.</p>
