        <h2 class="mt-0 pt-3" id="introduction">Introduction to the role of product designer</h2>
<p>Product designers are expected to understand the problem space, identify opportunities, and develop solutions using an iterative approach. Product designers are considered the “Empathizer in Chief.” They’re the primary user advocate and engage in continuous research throughout the product life cycle. As user advocates, product designers create tight feedback loops to make sure the user’s voice is incorporated throughout the decision-making process. They work closely with the product manager (PM) and client to balance business and user needs in order to influence the product vision. Working end-to-end from concept to implementation, product designers conduct research, facilitate design activities, and ensure the product team is building the right thing.</p>

<p>Below you’ll find the full list of skills for becoming a product designer at Skylight and a description of the skills required for each level. These descriptions offer insight into the scope of work someone at each level should be capable of doing on a consistent basis. We use these role descriptions both as a guide during the hiring process and as a springboard for discussing career progression at Skylight.</p>

<h3 id="required-skills">Required skills</h3>

<h4 id="research">Research</h4>

<p>You’re able to plan, synthesize, and share out generative and evaluative user research. You accurately scope research efforts, and use that research to inform product and design direction.</p>

<h4 id="interaction-design">Interaction design</h4>

<p>You define end-to-end flows while taking into account edge cases, error states, accessibility, and scalability. You understand and incorporate intentional information architecture (IA), systems thinking, design principles, and common design patterns.</p>

<h4 id="visual-design">Visual design</h4>

<p>You create simple and elegant user interface designs. You know how to evolve existing visual systems (e.g., style, spacing, components) with clear rationale. You stay up-to-date with industry trends. You have skills in some other visual design areas, such as branding, illustration, iconography, typography, or microinteractions.</p>

<h4 id="design-process">Design process</h4>

<p>You gather feedback and iterate on design work early and often. You’re familiar with different design processes such as double diamond, design thinking, and equity-centered design. You document your process through artifacts such as journey maps, service blueprints, and jobs-to-be done. Your documentation creates a compelling story to help your team and stakeholders empathize with the users.</p>

<h4 id="product-strategy">Product strategy</h4>

<p>You understand agile and lean methodology. As the primary voice of the user, you continuously advocate for their needs and pain points. You’re adept at prioritizing and balancing user and business decisions. You craft mental models to define and refine product opportunities while also supporting product thinking and decision making.</p>

<h4 id="facilitation-and-communication">Facilitation and communication</h4>

<p>You can articulate design rationale to various groups (users, teammates, stakeholders). You’re adept at receiving and giving feedback constructively. You utilize design activities to gain alignment with cross-functional disciplines through knowledge sharing and convergent/divergent thinking. You know how to negotiate trade-offs when necessary. You know how to incorporate storytelling for effective and engaging communication.</p>

<h4 id="leadership">Leadership</h4>

<p>You drive excellence in your team’s design execution. You know how to build positive influences in product direction, stakeholder relations, and organizational leadership. You can easily build and establish relationships with designers and non-designers.</p>
