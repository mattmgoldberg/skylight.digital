I"ÿ'<p>Over the past few months, weâ€™ve engaged with a number of new clients, including the State of Connecticut to improve how preschool development services are provided to children (from birth through age five) and families and the Air Force to modernize a twenty-something-year-old aviation resource management system.</p>

<p>To support these new projects, weâ€™ve grown our design, product, engineering, and transformation teams. Since <a href="https://skylight.digital/blog/five-former-presidential-innovation-fellows-and-18f-cofounders-join-skylight/">launching two years ago</a>, weâ€™ve been working incredibly hard to recruit and cultivate an <a href="https://skylight.digital/about/">amazing group of people</a>. With that said, weâ€™re excited to introduce you to our newest team members!</p>

<h2>Marvo Dolor, Engagement Manager</h2>

<p><a href="https://skylight.digital/about/#marvo-dolor">Marvo</a> is drawn to solving complex, multi-faceted government problems.

"Veterans described the VA appeals process as a &apos;black hole,&apos; where their disability compensation claim could sit for years without any updates from the VA. I led a team to develop an Appeals Status tool that provided veterans with plain-language updates. It contributed to a 40% reduction in call center volumes, but more importantly a veteran said of the new tool, &apos;It gives me hope.&apos;"
