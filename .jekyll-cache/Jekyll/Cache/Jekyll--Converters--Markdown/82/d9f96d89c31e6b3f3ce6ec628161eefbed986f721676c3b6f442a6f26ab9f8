I"π<p>If there‚Äôs one thing that we learned during our time at <a href="/work/18f-consulting/">18F</a> it‚Äôs that delivering short bursts of consulting work, focused on a specific topic, can empower government managers and teams with the critical know-how they need to produce great technology outcomes. In other words, not everything requires a full-fledged consulting engagement.</p>

<p>Now with Skylight, we‚Äôre excited to take what we‚Äôve learned from executing these types of focused, quick-turnaround, high-impact consulting engagements to the next level. We call it <a href="/services/microconsulting/">Microconsulting Services</a>.</p>

<h2>What is microconsulting?</h2>

<p>Microconsulting is a special type consulting format that features an individual or small team who produces an immediate deliverable on a specific topic for a low cost. Think of it as a quick and easy means of supplementing your team with supercharged brains.</p>

<h2>Why should you consider microconsulting?</h2>

<p>Government managers and teams are modern knowledge workers (educated, experienced, adaptable) who are quite capable of performing their jobs superbly. Sometimes, however, they lack specific skills/knowledge in 1‚Äì2 areas for a given task or project. It might not be possible or practical to fill those gaps through extensive training. In addition, access to internal resources with such know-how might not be available, and engaging an outside firm in a full-blown consulting engagement would simply be overkill.</p>

<p>This is the type of problem that microconsulting is designed to solve. Experts who can supplement, even level-up, your team‚Äôs existing skills and knowledge base with a short burst of intellectual horsepower. Whether it‚Äôs rapidly prototyping an idea to facilitate strategic decision-making, conducting a workshop to teach a new technical skill, pinpointing code-quality issues behind a slow-moving software development project, evaluating the suitability of an open-source-software alternative, or providing feedback on how well a solicitation aligns with agile delivery practices, there are tons of useful applications for microconsulting.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also a great, low-risk way to test out the capabilities of a firm before engaging in a larger body of work (that is, ‚Äútry before buying‚Äù).</p>
