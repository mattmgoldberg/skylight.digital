I"Œ<p>At Skylight, we take seriously our responsibility to protect people‚Äôs information from unwarranted disclosure.</p>

<p>We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered, as set out in this policy, so that we can fix them and keep our information safe.</p>

<p>This policy describes <strong>what systems and types of research</strong> are covered under this policy, <strong>how to send</strong> us vulnerability reports, and <strong>how long</strong> we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>We require that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.</li>
  <li>Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to ‚Äúpivot‚Äù to other systems. Once you‚Äôve established that a vulnerability exists, or encountered any of the sensitive data outlined below, you must stop your test and notify us immediately.</li>
  <li>Keep confidential any information about discovered vulnerabilities for up to 90 calendar days after you‚Äôve notified Skylight. For details, please review <a href="#coordinated-disclosure">Coordinated Disclosure</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>This policy applies to the following systems: skylight.digital.</p>

<p><strong>Any services not expressly listed above, such as any connected services, are excluded from scope and aren‚Äôt authorized for testing.</strong> Additionally, vulnerabilities found in non-Skylight systems from our vendors fall outside of this policy‚Äôs scope and should be reported directly to the vendor according to their disclosure policy (if any). If you aren‚Äôt sure whether a system or endpoint is in scope or not, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@skylight.digital">hello@skylight.digital</a> before starting your research.</p>

<p><strong>The following test types aren‚Äôt authorized:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>User interface bugs or typos</li>
  <li>Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests</li>
  <li>Physical testing (such as office access, open doors, or tailgating), social engineering (such as phishing or vishing), or any other non-technical vulnerability testing</li>
</ul>

<p>If you encounter any of the below on our systems while testing within the scope of this policy, <strong>stop your test and notify us at</strong> <a href="mailto:hello@skylight.digital">hello@skylight.digital</a> <strong>immediately</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personally identifiable information</li>
  <li>Financial information (for example, credit card or bank account numbers)</li>
  <li>Proprietary information or trade secrets of companies of any party</li>
</ul>

<h2>Authorization</h2>

<p>If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we‚Äôll consider your research to be authorized, will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and Skylight won‚Äôt initiate or recommend legal action related to your research.</p>

<h2>Reporting a vulnerability</h2>

<p>We accept and discuss vulnerability reports via email at <a href="mailto:hello@skylight.digital">hello@skylight.digital</a>. Reports may be submitted anonymously. <strong>Note: we don‚Äôt support PGP-encrypted emails.</strong> For particularly sensitive information, please don‚Äôt submit via email. <a href="mailto:hello@skylight.digital">Contact us</a> to arrange an alternative mechanism.</p>

<p>Reports should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability.</li>
  <li>A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability. Proof of concept (POC) scripts, screenshots, and screen captures are all helpful. Please use extreme care to properly label and protect any exploit code.</li>
  <li>Any technical information and related materials that we‚Äôd need to reproduce the issue.
Please keep your vulnerability reports current by sending us any new information as it becomes available.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may share your vulnerability reports with <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ais">US-CERT</a>, as well as any affected vendors or open source projects.</p>

<h2 id="coordinated-disclosure">Coordinated Disclosure</h2>

<p>Skylight is committed to patching vulnerabilities within 90 days or less, and disclosing the details of those vulnerabilities when patches are published. We believe that public disclosure of vulnerabilities is an essential part of the vulnerability disclosure process, and that one of the best ways to make software better is to enable everyone to learn from each other‚Äôs mistakes.</p>

<p>At the same time, we believe that disclosure in absence of a readily available patch tends to increase risk rather than reduce it, and so we ask that you refrain from sharing your report with others while we work on our patch. If you believe there are others that should be informed of your report before the patch is available, please let us know so we can make arrangements.</p>

<p>We may want to coordinate an advisory with you to be published simultaneously with the patch, but you‚Äôre also welcome to self-disclose if you prefer. By default, we prefer to disclose everything, but we‚Äôll never publish information about you or our communications with you without your permission. In some cases, we may also have some sensitive information that should be redacted, and so please check with us before self-disclosing.</p>

<h2>Future changes</h2>

<p>If we decide to change this policy, we‚Äôll update the modification date below.</p>
