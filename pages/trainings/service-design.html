          Why service design?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Government services involve a complex mix of components, such as
          policies, operations, people, and technology. For people accessing
          government services, this complexity is often passed onto them. This
          results in disjointed and frustrating experiences, or worse — not
          getting the services they need. For example, how many times have you
          been transferred from one customer support agent to the next, only to
          have to repeat the same information over and over again? This type of
          inefficiency is due to a lack of service design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through service design, government organizations can take a more
          holistic, human-centered approach to providing services, including
          both the “frontstage” (what the user sees) and the “backstage” (what
          happens behind the scenes). The result is optimized, end-to-end user
          experiences that deliver greater public value.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Design Management Institute,
          <a
            href="https://hbr.org/2014/04/design-can-drive-exceptional-returns-for-shareholders"
            >design-centric organizations consistently achieve high levels of
            performance</a
          >. Clear benefits and tangible results mean organizations across all
          industries, including government, are increasingly investing in
          service design.

            Always design a thing by considering it in its larger context — a
            chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an
            environment in a city plan.

        <p>
          Our goal is to help you embed service design ways of thinking and
          working throughout your entire organization. To accomplish that, our
          experts collaborate with you to identify your goals and needs, then
          pair with you to solve complex problems and build internal capacity
          using the Skylight Service Design Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our framework draws on years of experience working on complex
          government projects. It leverages best practices for building services
          that work better for users and the government offices who administer
          them.

          How to engage with us
        </h2>
        <p>
          The best way to contract with Skylight is through the federal
          government’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) / Small
          Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this program, the U.S. Air Force awarded Skylight a series of
          STTR contracts related to service design. Any government agency can
          leverage these contracts to issue direct (or non-competitive) awards —
          without dollar, time, or size standard restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
