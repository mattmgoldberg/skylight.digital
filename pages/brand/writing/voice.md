## Voice qualities

Our voice has five key qualities that are felt in both what we say and how we say it. Working together, these qualities make everything we write sound uniquely Skylight.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
**Expressive.** We use simple words and phrases to convey profound thoughts and big feelings.

**Smart.** We bring unique knowledge and insights to the conversation.

**Lighthearted.** The world is tough. The work we do is tough. We don't take ourselves too seriously, and we're easy to work with.

**Embracing.** Whoever you are, we're your biggest supporter.

**Worldly.** We’re interested, knowledgeable, and always learning. We have a broad worldview, but we’re not know-it-alls.
