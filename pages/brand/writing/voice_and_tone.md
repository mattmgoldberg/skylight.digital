description: Skylight’s voice is our personality distilled into writing. It’s crucial for our audience to recognize us even if we don’t announce ourselves. While our voice is constant, we should adjust our tone depending on the context and the specific audience.

## Voice qualities

Our voice has five key qualities that are felt in both what we say and how we say it. Working together, these qualities make everything we write sound uniquely Skylight.

**Expressive.** We use simple words and phrases to convey profound thoughts and big feelings.

**Smart.** We bring unique knowledge and insights to the conversation.

**Lighthearted.** The world is tough. The work we do is tough. We don't take ourselves too seriously, and we're easy to work with.

**Embracing.** Whoever you are, we're your biggest supporter.

**Worldly.** We’re interested, knowledgeable, and always learning. We have a broad worldview, but we’re not know-it-alls.

## Tone qualities

Modulating tone helps us tailor our words to any specific audience. By keeping users and partners in mind, you allow yourself to see someone else’s perspective, helping you better understand their wants and needs, and speak to them in ways they can engage with.

For further reference, [Skylight’s Content Guide](/work/toolkits/content-guide/voice-and-tone/) offers examples of our voice qualities in practice as well as examples of how we adapt our tone to different contexts.
