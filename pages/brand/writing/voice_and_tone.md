description: Skylight’s voice is our personality distilled into writing. It’s crucial for our audience to recognize us even if we don’t announce ourselves. While our voice is constant, we should adjust our tone depending on the context and the specific audience.

## Voice qualities

Our voice helps us convey who we are to our audience and is defined by our values and goals as a company. Having a consistent voice is essential, regardless of who creates the content. Skylight’s voice has five key qualities that are felt in both what we say and how we say it:

<div class="example" markdown="1">
- Expressive
- Smart
- Lighthearted
- Embracing
- Worldly
</div>
Working together, these qualities make everything we write sound uniquely Skylight.

For further reference, Skylight’s [Content Guide](/work/toolkits/content-guide/voice-and-tone/) offers more context around each voice quality and provides examples of our voice qualities in practice.

## Tone qualities

Modulating tone helps us tailor our words to any specific audience. By keeping users and partners in mind, you allow yourself to see someone else’s perspective, helping you better understand their wants and needs, and speak to them in ways they can engage with.

See our [Content Guide](/work/toolkits/content-guide/voice-and-tone/#skylights-tone) for examples of how we adapt our tone to different contexts.
