<h1>Brand Guidelines</h1>
<p>
  Hello! Welcome to Skylight’s brand guidelines. Our guidelines are designed to

  prospective hires. If you can’t find what you need, please contact us.

  <h2>Working with customers and partners</h2>
  <p>
    At Skylight, you’ll often be working alongside customers with their own
    design systems and branding. For example, if you’re helping your U.S. Air
    Force client prepare a presentation to a four-star general, you should most
    likely be using their brand guidelines — not ours.
