{% capture img_desc_1 %}
Use hair and skin colors, as needed, to represent the diverse world.

Accent minimally with light gray.

Creating texture with patterns adds personality to the images.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture img_desc_2 %}
Illustrations are crafted using offset outlines with selected fills.

Organizational clothing (such as military uniforms) is an exception to the limited palette â€” it should reflect real life.
{% endcapture %}
