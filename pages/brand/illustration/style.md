# Style

To maintain consistency our illustrations use color, lines, and fills in a similar way.

Use hair and skin colors, as needed, to represet the diverse world

Accent minimally with light gray

Creating texture with patterns adds personality to the images

Illustrations are crafted using offset outlines with selected fills

Organizational clothing (such as military uniforms) is an exception to the limited palette â€” it should reflect real life
