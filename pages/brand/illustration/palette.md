# Palette

To create unity and cohesion within the brand, we use color in a specific way.

The limited the color palette, combined with the offset outlines, creates sophisticated, lighthearted, and positive tone.

## Primary colors

Choose one bright primary color per illustration. Outlines should be black. Use light  gray minimally as needed.

## Skin and hair

Use skin and hair colors as needed to reflect the diversity in the work around us. These color serve as a base to get started â€” they can get adjusted slightly to ensure contrast with the other colors in the illustration.
