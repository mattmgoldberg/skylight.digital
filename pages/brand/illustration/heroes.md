# Heroes

Hero banners are monochromatic.

The base color uses a primary color and the rest of the illustration uses lighter/darker shades. Each section of the website uses a one color.

Hero banners are made of 2â€“4 illustration vingettes and the geometric shapes. The shapes are achored to the vingettes and sprinkled throughout the layout to drive focus to the text.
