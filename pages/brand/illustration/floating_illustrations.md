# Floating illustrations

Floating images don’t have borders or any background color.

They’re monochromatic using a bold color from the illustration palette. Accent with `Gray-100` and sparingly with light gray.

Even though illustrations are monochromatic, pages/layouts with many floating images should rotate through the different primary Skylight colors.

This images are used primarily within pages on the website.
