# Typography

## Typefaces

[Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin?query=fran&preview.text_type=custom) is the primary typeface with [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto+mono&preview.text_type=custom) serving as a complementary typeface. Both are available from Google Fonts.

## Usage

We keep it simple and easy to use. We primarily use Franklin Libre Semibold, Regular, and Light. Roboto Mono comes in more sparingly.

See our [Document Templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1c9vEFespRGtH9yGAOIpOCZaGIr6eeXSe) for more examples of the brand in use.
