# Colors

## Intro

The world is a diverse and wonderful place. We want to reflect that in how we work, whom we work with, and the colors we use — that's why we've developed a bright and beautiful palette.

## Primary palette

The Skylight brand mainly uses blue, gray, and light yellow.  The blue is the accent color for the gray text. The light ochre is a tertiary color that is used for backgrounds.

## Secondary palette

The secondary palette is comprised of the rest of the color logos. These colors, along with blue, are used primarily in illustrations.

The gray colors are used for text, charts, etc.

## Tints

The original base palette (indicated by the `-100` suffix)  has been extended to provide a practical range of values for web/screen applications.

Labels have been added to each swatch so you can check whether there’s sufficient  contrast to meet WCAG AA standards.
