# Logo

## Intro

How we write our name, how we use our symbols — these are the closest we get to a "signature" for Skylight. How they appear, whether tiny on a screen or enormous at an airport, becomes a crucial way for our customers and partners to find and trust us.

## Logotype and logomark

Our logo consists of two elements: the logotype and the "halo" — or logomark or icon. The logotype should never appear without the logomark. The halo can be used separately from the logotype as an icon.

To aid in brand awareness, the logotype + logomark is typically used in our customer-facing assets (e.g., presentation) and in spaces managed by other organizations (e.g., conference).

The halo in its raised position after the logotype conveys enlightenment (facilitating a deeper understanding) and hopefulness (something good is going to happen).

The circular form symbolizes cycle (a feedback loop), inclusion (designing for everyone), and wholeness (such as addressing the whole user experience).

-

The logotype uses a wide kerning to make our brand feel open and accessible.

-

The four colors in our logo convey the diversity and inclusiveness of our team. We encourage diverse ideas from multiple perspectives (race, age, sexual and gender identity, life experiences, etc.).

Using primary colors demonstrates how we start with basic building blocks, and can combine them into anything.

**Each individual color has its own meanings:**

**Blue:** sky, wisdom, depth of understanding, trustworthy, dependable, committed, sad

**Green:** nature, balance, growth, health, freshness, sustainability, progress, forgiveness, compassion

**Yellow:** sun/light, optimism, happiness, playfulness, creativity, clarity, caution

**Red:** energy, passion, authority, confidence, change, action, anger, danger

## Light and dark

Use the standard logo in areas with a light background (`Ochre-40` and `white`). Use the inverse logo in areas with a dark background (`Black-300`, `Red-200`, `Blue-300`, and `Green-300`).

Always aim to use one of these versions. The colors reinforce the brand identity.

## Grayscale

If a black and white version of the logo is required, use the standard grayscale logo in areas with a light background. Use the inverse grayscale logo in areas with a dark background. This logo should only be used when the color logo isn’t an option.

## One color

This version of the logo is for instances in which only one color is allowed. This will most likely be for printing swag/merchandise — processes like etching need a silhouette version of a logo.

## Variations

This variation of the logo can be used in instances, such as templates, where the logo needs a bit more separation from content.

## Spacing

The halo is positioned after the logotype at a distance of x to the right and 2x above the baseline where x is the thickness of the halo band.

A clearspace of 2x is recommended around the logo.

## Minimum sizes

Legibility is critical for a logo — it should always be readable.

Never scale the logo smaller than the sizes specified.

## General positioning

The logo’s position in a print or digital piece should also be positioned.

The logo looks best positioned to the left, so try there first.

In some instances, the center or the upper or lower right-hand corners might make more sense.

## Rotation

In most cases, the logo should sit at 0° angle. This is the default.

On special occasions, the logo can be turned on a 90° angle. This is useful for very vertical layouts like banners ads, physical banners, and swag.

## Things to avoid

- change the color of the logo
- skew the logo’s width or height
- recreate the logo in another font
- outline the logo
- place an image in the logo
- use the logo over a busy background
- rotate the logo to anything other than 0 and 90 degrees
- change the logo’s proportions
