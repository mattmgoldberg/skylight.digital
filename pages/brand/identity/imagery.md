# Imagery

## Illustration

We use illustration as our primary visual style. It makes us feel different and vibrant, and helps us tell better stories through art. Illustrations are a key part of Skylight’s brand.

Creating new artwork? You should check the [Illustration Guidelines](/brand/illustration/principles/).

## Photography

When sharing photos, we want to feature real people with real-life stories to tell. Capture a sense of place by showing activities with teammates, customers, and partners.

Facial expressions, clothing, hair/makeup should look natural (not over-the-top stock).

### Goals

Every image should tell a story. There are a few tricks we can use to make sure our message comes across to viewers.

- Figure out: “What am I trying to say with this photo?”
- Capture all relevant objects, people, and background
- Focus your image on people in action, facial expressions, and body language
- Consider the composition of your image
- Take a moment to remove any distractions from the scene

**"What am I trying to say with this photo?"**

Determing this will ensure that you include everything you need to convey your message. What objects, people, and background context are needed to express the story?

People are drawn to people. Focus your image on candid facial expressions and body language, not backs and backs of heads.
Show people in action. Bonus points for capturing things that are unique or unusual.

Wrap this all together in your composition. If an object is the focus of your photo, catch the subject interacting/looking at it. Test a couple of angles to see what makes the story most clear.

If possible, take a moment to remove any distractions from the scene. If it doesn’t help tell the story, move it out of the way. These items can oven be little things our brain automatically de-emphasizes, like purses, coffee cups, and wrappers, but these muddle the story in a photo.

## Portraits

We aim to take authentic portraits of people.

Use a shallow depth of field in an outdoor setting.

When possible, set up images to include an element of blue (in clothing or surroundings).

The photo should be edited to use a realistic color balance.
