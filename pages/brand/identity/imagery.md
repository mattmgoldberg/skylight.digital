## Illustration

We use illustration as our primary visual style. It makes us feel different and vibrant, and helps us tell better stories through art. Illustrations are a key part of Skylight’s brand.

Creating new artwork? You should check out our [illustration brand guidelines](/brand/illustration/principles/).

## Photography

When sharing photos, we want to feature real people with real-life stories to tell. Capture a sense of place by showing activities with teammates, customers, and partners.

Facial expressions, clothing, hair/makeup should look natural (not over-the-top stock).

Every image should tell a story. There are a few tricks we can use to make sure our message comes across to viewers:

- Figure out what you're trying to say with this photo
- Capture all relevant objects, people, and background
- Focus your image on people in action, facial expressions, and body language
- Consider the composition of your image
- Take a moment to remove any distractions from the scene

## Portraits

We aim to take authentic portraits of people.

Use a shallow depth of field in an outdoor setting.

When possible, set up images to include an element of blue (in clothing or surroundings).

The photo should be edited to use a realistic color balance.
