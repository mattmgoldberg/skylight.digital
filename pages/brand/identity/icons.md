# Icons

## Intro

Because Skylight's presence largely exists online, the consistent appearance of our icon is critical in ensuring our audience recognizes our brand across various spaces. In many cases, this symbol is the first introduction that people have to Skylight.

## Avatars

Our icon is our face on social accounts, keeping Skylightâ€™s personality front and center. It can be safely used at a wide variety of sizes, as small as 16px like our favicon.

## Variants

Use the icon on the top for light backgrounds and the icon on the bottom for dark (including the darker blue).

Inverse color
