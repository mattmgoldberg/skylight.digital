Appendix E: Sample Analysis of Procurement Options
--------------------------------------------------

In deciding which procurement strategy would best fit the needs of a
product, developing an analysis of alternatives for the different
options that are available helps provide data to make decisions.

Here is an example of an analysis of alternatives that the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) did when determining which
contracting vehicle would best support the product.

## Medicare Payment Modernization Contracting Strategy

As modernization efforts transitions from proof of concepts on the
Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) to a production roadmap,
serious thought must be put into the contracting strategy to support
this effort for the next 5-10 years. ***Setting up the correct
contracting strategy has the largest impact on the probability of
success on this effort***. The FISS system is the initial target for
proof of concepts to be transitioned into production, this effort
shouldn't be limited to just that system. This is a unique opportunity
to synthesize diverse Medicare payment systems. Including the following:

* Common Working File (CWF)
* Multi-Carrier System (MCS)
* VIPS Medicare Shared System (VMS)
* CMMI models

To achieve the goal of a successful payment modernization effort,
contracting strategy must enable the following factors:

* Ability to award new tasks quickly
* Quality of technical talent available via contract vehicle
* Contractor Digital Service experience and approach (this is
different than "agile development")
* Familiarity with CMS systems, specifically complex business logic
associated with Medicare FFS payment processing
* Ability to define development and infrastructure requirements at the
BPA level so details are not missed in task orders

There exists a variety of contracting options, each with pros and cons.
It is the effort of this document to determine which contracting option
best suits needs for this modernization effort. Ultimately, the decision
on choosing the right contracting strategy needs to answer the simple
question of: Will this vehicle/strategy position the Medicare Payment
Modernization effort to have the greatest probability of success?

***SPARC***

OIT at CMS has an existing IDIQ, SPARC, that is the agency's answer to
agile, waterfall, and hybrid development methodologies. This vehicle has
a $25B ceiling that houses over 140 different vendors. Its goal is to
be the one-stop shop for agency development. There are certainly
advantages to leveraging work already completed as well as drawbacks to
leveraging a generic development contacting vehicle.


|  Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
|  The IDIQ is already existing and vendors have been pre-vetted. | The vendor pool is not specialized to any project. |
|  The vendor pool is diverse based on company size. | The vendor pool is so large the agile contracting is impossible. |
|  The ceiling on the IDIQ is extremely high – low risk of breaking through it. | The probability of protest per contract is substantially higher due to more vendor bids and issues with small business sizes. |
|  Orders under $10M are not protestable. | Agile methodologies, user-center design, user design, and DevOps practices are not baked into the IDIQ and thus need to be included with each proposal. This bloats the proposal with boilerplate language while increasing the surface area of protest. |
|  All contract types permissible giving CMS added flexibility. | Most vendors are not familiar with CMS payment processing and could struggle to meet the quick on boarding and rapidly changing needs of this project |
|  Helping CMS meet small business goals. | Ability to award new tasks quickly. |

***SPARC with on-ramp***

This option has the ability to continue leveraging SPARC while allowing
for new vendors to be added to the IDIQ. This list includes all of the
Pros and Cons listed previous with SPARC with the following
consideration.

|  Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
|  Ability to add new entrants to the cadre of pre-qualified vendors that could compete for agile development work | High protest probability - would require a competitive process which could be protested – there are two points of protest because we already have a large vetted pool of contractors plus the source selection decision |
|  - | Additional resources need on OAGM and program side to manage source selection process |
{: .table}

***GWAC – Alliant 2, CIO SP3***

|  Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
|  Existing pre-vetted cadre of qualified vendors | BIC designation which will help CMS meet OMB targets |
|  Orders under $10M not protestable | Agency could receive criticism for not using SPARC which was intended, in part, for agile development; however, climate is pushing agencies toward Category Management and SUM/BIC use |
|  All contract types permissible | Not all vendors will have subject matter expertise with CMS systems or payment processing |
|  Alliant 2 explicitly includes agile development services |  |
{: .table}

***Agency Wide BPA***

|  Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
|  Targeted competition possible; however, must provide RFQ to any company requesting it | Vendors are not tailored to the project's specific goals. |
|  Ability to reach new contractors who have entered the market for initial competition | Initial award and any calls are protestable |
|  BPA holders will be specifically selected based upon demonstrated ability to develop and deploy digital services using agile methodologies, user centered design and DevOps. | New umbrella contract vehicle is resource intensive versus placing individual orders against existing contract vehicles |
|  Could receive OMB designation as a SUM vehicle but requires mandatory use policy and other reporting requirements | If significant overlap to existing SUM/BIC vehicle, modified business case to OMB required |
|  - | If approved by OMB, and BPA put in place, CMS mandatory use policy and rigorous reporting requirements needed |
|  - | Inability to add new contractors to mix after award of BPA |
|  - | Risk of ending up with a significant number of vendors in pool |
|  - | Agency could receive criticism for not using SPARC which was intended, in part, for agile development |
{: .table}

***GSA Schedule Task Order Competitions***

The GSA Schedule is available for individual task orders as they are
necessary.

|  Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
|  Existing pre-vetted cadre of qualified vendors | Not a SUM or BIC vehicle. |
|  New contractors are constantly being added to the industrial base. | Hundreds of vendors; however, FPDS data shows that [x] proposals are received on average |
|  Targeted competition possible (to reasonably ensure receipt of at least 3 quotations); must provide RFQ to any company requesting it. | Limited to FFP or L-H; however, these contract types are consistent with commercial practices for buying agile development |
{: .table}


***Project Specific BPA off of GSA Schedule***

|  Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
|  The vendors are tailored to the project's needs | Initial award and any calls are protestable |
|  Contracts can be issued as new problems or requirements are encountered. | Multiple program specific BPAs are resource intensive for the agency to award and manage |
|  Smaller pool of specialized vendors. | If the vendors are smaller companies, there is risk of being unable to meet the needs of the total work necessary for the project. |
|  The pool of vendors all become domain experts as the project matures. | If significant overlap to existing SUM/BIC vehicle, modified business case to OMB required |
|  Agile methodologies, user-center design, user design, and DevOps practices can be baked into the BPA. This avoids proposals with boilerplate language while focusing on the objectives. | If approved by OMB, and BPA put in place, CMS mandatory use policy and rigorous reporting requirements needed |
|  The base period on awarded contracts is shorter.<br/> <br/>CMS is put into the position of less risk by requiring results from vendors faster.<br/> <br/>CMS does not have the pressure to award existing vendors on a contract re-compete due to transition time shorten via domain knowledge. This drive competition. | - |
|  Avoids single points of failure. Re-competes are actually encouraged. | - |
{: .table}

While there are a variety of potential contracting options available, to
date, the most successful approach to complex system development at CMS
using an innovative, Digital Service approach, was done on the Quality
Payment Program.

Some high-level stats on the QPP BPA to date:

* There have been 16 task orders awarded under ADELE.
* All vendors are small businesses.
* Every ADELE BPA holder has won an award at this point.
* All ADELE task orders have been competitively awarded.
* Zero Protests.
* The average procurement action lead time is 67 days.
* The average Period of Performance for an ADELE task order is 2.2
years.
* Responses were typically limited to 20-25 pages with 2-week
turnarounds.
* Low dollar value allows for COR II rather than COR III.

***A Tale of Two Contract Vehicles: A Retrospective***

As previously listed, the goals for our contracting strategy are:

* Ability to award new tasks quickly
* Quality of technical talent available via contract vehicle
* Contractor Digital Service experience and approach (this is
different than "agile development")
* Familiarity with CMS systems, specifically complex business logic
associated with Medicare FFS payment processing
* Ability to define development and infrastructure requirements at the
BPA level so details are not missed in task orders

CMS has experience over the past year issuing contracts through both
SPARC and ADELE and there are some great data points that can be
gathered to compare the two vehicles against the goals that we are
aiming for.

***Ability to award new tasks quickly***

Working in an agile fashion means not having all of the business
requirements up front. Most of the time this process is impossible and a
vast majority of the time the initial business requirement gathering for
a complex system is incorrect. As new requirements come to light
throughout the modernization process, the ability to issue contracts
rapidly is necessary.


|  **Vehicle** | **Ability to award new tasks quickly** |
| :--- | :--- |
|  SPARC | Competitive task orders averaged 139 days (19.9 weeks) |
|  ADELE BPA | Competitive task orders averaged 67 days. (9.5 weeks) |
{: .table}


***Quality of technical talent available via contract vehicle***

Competition is vital in making sure the government is getting the best
possible vendor for the job. More vendors does not always mean better
competition. Contracts see the best competition when vendors specialize
in the work that issued. Overall competition increases as vendors learn
through previous proposals. Finding the sweet spot of the vendor pool
size that allows for competition and allows vendors to continuously
challenge each other to rise the skill level is important.

|  **Vehicle** | **Quality of technical talent available via contract vehicle** |
| :--- | :--- |
|  SPARC | The density of high skilled vendors is variable. Roughly 5% of the total vendors have won a competitive proposal under SPARC. |
|  ADELE BPA | 100% of the vendors have won a competitive proposal under ADELE. Each one of these competitive proposals included a design challenge that required working software and designs to be submitted. |
{: .table}

***Contractor Digital Service experience and approach (this is different
than "agile development")***

User-centered design, user research, devops, and product management are
required to deliver modern digital services. These skill sets along with
an agile methodology are necessary in delivering working software in
small increments allowing for quickly changing development and design as
new requirements are discovered.


|  **Vehicle** | **Contractor Digital Service Experience** |
| :--- | :--- |
|  SPARC | Partners offer agile, waterfall, and hybrid development methodology. Having digital service skill sets were not prerequisites for joining SPARC. |
|  ADELE BPA | 100% of the vendors on ADELE went through market research making sure that modern digital services and agile development practices were core to their business. |
{: .table}

***Familiarity with CMS systems, specifically complex business logic
associated with Medicare FFS payment processing***

Having a background with CMS programs allows vendors to hit the ground
running when contracts are awarded. The amount of time that is required
to either onboard or transition work is diminished when vendors already
know systems that they will be working on. Having these familiarities
allows for the period of performance to decrease and thus protecting CMS
from getting locked into a vendor that underperforms. In addition to
familiarity, having a smaller vendor pool means that contractors and
their employees already have accounts, access and the ability to quickly
begin work after contract award.

In some cases it takes over two months for *new* contractors to get
access to CMS systems, this would make any attempt at iterative
development dead on arrival.

|  **Vehicle** | **Familiarity with CMS systems.** |
| :--- | :--- |
|  SPARC | The average period of performance for a SPARC task order is 3.8 years. |
|  ADELE BPA | The average period of performance for an ADELE task order is 2.2 years. |
{: .table}

***Ability to define development and infrastructure requirements at the
BPA level so details are not missed in task orders***

Having certain requirements that can be found in all contracts that are
intended to go out under the vehicle can benefit from having these
requirements baked into the vehicle directly vs requiring justification
on each contract. This protects CMS from potentially missing common
contracting needs with each contract issued. This also cuts down on the
size of the proposal that needs to be reviewed with each task order.


|  **Vehicle** | **Requirements baked into the vehicle** |
| :--- | :--- |
|  SPARC | None. |
|  ADELE BPA | Agile methodologies. Digital Service requirements. |
