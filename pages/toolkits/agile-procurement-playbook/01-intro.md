**Agile Procurement Handbook**
==============================

Purpose of this handbook
------------------------

The purpose of this handbook is to introduce an agile procurement model
for software services, cover how it differs from some of the more
traditional procurement plays, and introduce an iterative roadmap on
transitioning towards a more agile procurement environment. While the
handbook can help government contracting teams strategize on new
procurements, the information within is best treated as a collection of
helpful suggestions rather than strict guidance.

### Intended audience

An agile procurement strategy includes stakeholders that traditionally
might not have had a seat at the table during a product’s initial
planning phases. Because the strategy requires a greater understanding
of a product’s objectives and goals along with the adoption of a modular
contracting approach, the following roles will need to have early input
on new products that will be requiring procurements:

-   Agency contracting officer/specialist who is supporting the product,
-   Agency product manager, and
-   The agency’s digital services team of engineering, design, and
    research.

This procurement strategy is most effective when these roles act as a
single team supporting the overall product.

Executive summary
-----------------

In a quick overview of the US federal IT project landscape,
[*Brookings*](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/08/25/doomed-challenges-and-solutions-to-government-it-projects/)
reported that in 2014:

-   \$75.6 billion was spent on IT per year — this is more than the
    entire venture capital industry spends annually combined.
-   94% of the projects are over budget or behind schedule.
-   40% of the projects are scrapped or abandoned.

Setting up the correct contracting strategy has the largest impact on
the probability of success on most government products. Because of this
importance, it’s essential to measure performance indicators that track
outcomes in order to:

-   Set direction and monitor the progress of the work, and
-   Intervene promptly when progress isn’t tracking towards the
    product’s objectives.

Procurement flexibility is the substrate underlying successful project
management. Procurement flexibility can be defined as the ability to:

-   Award new tasks quickly,
-   Shorten the initial period of performance,
-   Optimize for contracts that speed digital service delivery for end
    users, and
-   Have a diverse pool of quality vendors that has digital service
    experience to draw from.

The overarching goal for every procurement is presumably to deliver
defined, expected outcomes for the product or service being procured.
But the procurement strategy determines the amount of risk assumed in
pursuit of that goal.

An agile procurement approach reduces the risks of product development
by tailoring procurements to the products being built to meet the user’s
needs rather than having a generic procurement structure. Ultimately,
this requires integrating the procurement team into the product
management team.
