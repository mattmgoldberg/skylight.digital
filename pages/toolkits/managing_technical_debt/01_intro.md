# Introduction

Technical debt is a financial metaphor that software developers use to talk to managers about the “hidden” costs associated with a system’s architecture and codebase (for example, changing requirements addressed with a “quick fix,” bugs deferred in favor of new development, design weaknesses, or aging third-party libraries). Technical debt costs organizations time as well as money. [Recent studies](http://www.castsoftware.com/research-labs/technical-debt-estimation), seeking to estimate the financial impact of technical debt, suggest that an average debt of $3.61 exists per line of software code, or an average of $1.08 million per system. In 2010, [Gartner estimated](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1439513) that the total amount of technical debt worldwide could reach $1 trillion this year. Given that the federal government builds and maintains a lot of software, it’s safe to assume that it carries a fair share of that debt.

## Why care about the government's technical debt?

Technical debt can make software resistant and costly to change, and prone to outages, intermittent failures, and even [security breaches](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/be-careful-not-to-incur-security-debt/). For users, this means fixes or features they need take more time to implement. For taxpayers, this means inefficient use of their hard-earned dollars. For program managers, this means greater risk that their debt-ridden systems become so untenable that they have to be ditched and rebuilt from scratch. For chief information officers, this means less budget and resource capacity to work on innovative projects that add value to their business partners. And for agency executives, this means systems that can’t be easily adapted to deliver new business capabilities, nor relied upon to support critical mission operations.

## How to use this toolkit

This toolkit is for anyone whose role touches on technology or software development – developers, managers, executives, and others. Technical debt is an insidious problem, and understanding what it is and how it happens are key steps in dealing with it. This toolkit explains what technical debt is (and why it’s not all bad), how to manage it, and some ways to prevent accumulating it. In each section, we've also curated some additional readings and resources you can use to learn more about the different aspects of technical debt and how to manage it. By the end of the toolkit, you'll have a foundational understanding in what technical debt is (including the different kinds of technical debt), how it can build up (and why that isn't always the worst thing), and what you can do about it from both a technical standpoint as well as an organizational and cultural one.
