Conventional wisdom often encourages engineers to start with a big architectural overview. Services with databases are connected via lines and arrows to other services. Caching layers, load balancers, and other complex shapes are wedged into the flow of information. For tech-savvy people, these diagrams give some comfort that performance and security are addressed. Non-tech people can point to the diagram with some comfort that very smart people are doing very complex things.
 
Architectural plans provide comfort to everyone because they look like a plan. The way forward is for the engineers to fill in servers and infrastructure, making the map real.
 
Unfortunately, this kind of a grand plan usually leads to technical-debt that collapses towards complete immobility. Complexities in even one of these services can take down the entire project. Unknown problems at the beginning can’t be rolled into the new plan easily because all services are dependent on this architectural contract.
 
In short, architectural plans push the team towards waterfall development, a system that has fallen out of favor as more and more projects have failed (this is a major reason that Skylight advocates for agile development and methodologies–it has a proven track record of successful best practices that emphasize on-time, valuable delivery of working software).
