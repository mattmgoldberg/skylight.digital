# Why should you care about technical debt?

Technical debt can make software resistant and costly to change, and prone to outages, intermittent failures, and even [security breaches](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/be-careful-not-to-incur-security-debt/). For users, this means fixes or features they need take more time to implement. For taxpayers, this means inefficient use of their hard-earned dollars. For program managers, this means greater risk that their debt-ridden systems become so untenable that they have to be ditched and rebuilt from scratch. For chief information officers, this means less budget and resource capacity to work on innovative projects that add value to their business partners. And for agency executives, this means systems that can’t be easily adapted to deliver new business capabilities, nor relied upon to support critical mission operations.
 
Importantly, technical debt costs organizations time as well as money. [Recent studies](http://www.castsoftware.com/research-labs/technical-debt-estimation), seeking to estimate the financial impact of technical debt, suggest that an average debt of $3.61 exists per line of software code, or an average of $1.08 million per system. In 2010, [Gartner estimated](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1439513) that the total amount of technical debt worldwide could reach $1 trillion this year. Given that the federal government builds and maintains a lot of software, it’s safe to assume that it carries a fair share of that debt. And as stewards of taxpayer dollars and servants to the needs of the public, it’s our responsibility to avoid such issues by understanding the consequences of technical debt and how to avoid them.
 
From annoying bugs to crippled projects, the effects of technical debt manifest in a variety of pernicious ways. Jim Highsmith’s technical debt curve, modified below, illustrates what happens as technical debt grows within a software product over time:
 
- The **cost (or difficulty)** of changing the software or project increases, eventually to the point where the code can no longer be feasibly maintained
- The **ability to respond to the needs of customers** decreases, making them extremely unhappy
- The **predictability of results** decreases, making management highly distrustful (producing accurate estimates of the time or money related to software with a high amount of debt is nearly impossible).

How do projects end up on the far right of the curve? And why is that a bad place to be? As [Highsmith explains](http://jimhighsmith.com/the-financial-implications-of-technical-debt/):
 
“One problem with technical debt is that the impact can be slow-growing and somewhat hidden. To the question ‘fix the technical debt, or build new features’ we know how it’s usually answered. As it gets worse, customers complain about slow delivery, increasing the pressure to take more shortcuts, which increases the technical debt, which slows the delivery process, which increases customer dissatisfaction, in a rapidly spiraling vicious cycle. Unfortunately, by the time many organizations are paying attention, all the solutions are bad ones: 1) do nothing and it gets worse, 2) replace/rewrite the software (expensive, high risk, doesn’t address the root cause problem), or 3) systematically invest in incremental improvement.”
 
Customers aren’t the only ones who [suffer the consequences](http://www.infoq.com/articles/managing-technical-debt) (annoying bugs, missing features, etc.) of technical debt, either. **Friendly help desk staff** will field more support calls. **Software operations teams** lose sleep patching the system all hours of the day. **Management** gets bad publicity due to bugs, delays, security issues, or outages. **Developers** have to deal with the bad work of other developers, which may cause turnover.
