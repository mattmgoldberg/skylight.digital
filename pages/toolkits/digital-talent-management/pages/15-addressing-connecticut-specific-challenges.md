Addressing Connecticut-specific challenges
==========================================

To understand the State’s challenges, we conducted a Digital Capability
Assessment workshop in June 2019. The workshop covered a range of topics
critical to technology delivery, including digital talent management.

The following observations are based on what we heard from workshop
participants.

Observation \#1: There’s a lack of digital talent capacity
----------------------------------------------------------

There is a lack of internal digital talent within the State. Almost all
of the technology staff are contractors. The existing technology
workforce represents legacy skill sets. The state wants to modernize and
fix a number of existing systems, but doesn’t have the capacity to do
so.

### Recommendations

-   Understand and quantify your digital talent gaps.

-   Build a holistic talent strategy.

-   Continue to build out a cross-functional CT Digital Services team.
    > Focus on increasing the digital talent density across the state.
    > This is your bright spot, to help recruit additional digital
    > talent.

-   Assemble high-impact, cross-functional digital teams around specific
    > initiatives or services.

Observation \#2: The work environment doesn’t support collaboration
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The current work environment — including the physical space and tools —
doesn’t support the collaborative ways individuals and teams need to
work.

“*We recently had someone quit within two weeks because the environment
isn’t set up to support the way they were expecting to work*.”

“*People work behind closed doors. There is no physical or virtual space
to facilitate more open collaboration.*”

### Recommendations

-   Accelerate the rollout of the collaboration tools that are already
    > in place today, such as Microsoft Teams.

-   Consider converting existing office space into a more open,
    > collaborative environment.

-   Empower teams to make decisions about which tools they need to
    > succeed. Then simplify the process for agency staff to request and
    > receive what they need.

Observation \#3 It’s difficult to hire and retain digital talent
----------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of challenges that make it difficult to acquire and
retain digital talent:

-   Constraints, such as salary limitations

-   Traditional approaches to hiring, including the current job
    > classification system

-   Management practices, like inflexible work arrangements

### Recommendations

-   To generate a stronger applicant pool, modernize job descriptions.
    > Current job descriptions are antiquated and don’t speak to the
    > actual role. Work with HR to create flexibility with job titles
    > and requirements.

-   Design and launch a branding and communication campaign around the
    > CT Digital Service and digital transformation writ large, to
    > attract the right talent. Focus on the impact of the work.

-   Since it will always be difficult for government to compete with
    > large technology companies on salary, consider other ways to
    > attract digital talent:

    -   Allow flexible working hours

    -   Allow remote work

    -   Make a commitment to supporting work/life balance

    -   Ensure that the work is always impactful, and that teams
        > understand the impact of their work

-   [*Keeping skills and ideas fresh*](#keeping-skills-and-ideas-fresh)

-   [*Building a movement and a
    > presence*](#building-a-movement-and-a-presence)

Observation \#4 The management model doesn’t support self-organizing teams
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current management model isn’t conducive to empowered,
cross-functional teams. While there are a number of cross-functional
teams in government, they’re not empowered to act on their own. Making
changes always requires multiple levels of approval.

### Recommendations

-   Develop and deliver training to executives on the new management
    > models and behaviors that are critical to becoming a digital
    > government. This requires moving from a bureaucratic culture to a
    > generative one.

-   Identify key digital and IT leadership positions that need to be
    > filled now or in the very near future. Ensure that modern,
    > technology-savvy executives are hired into those positions.
    > Getting the right leadership in place is the most important factor
    > in building a digital organization.
