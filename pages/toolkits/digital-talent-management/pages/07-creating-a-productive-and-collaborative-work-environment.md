Creating a productive and collaborative work environment
========================================================

Create a collaborative physical space
-------------------------------------

Physical space can encourage and facilitate collaboration.

As teams envision and build products, they need space for conducting
in-person workshops with users and stakeholders. A useful space for
workshops and trainings has:

-   Enough room for 20 to 30 people to move around
-   Plenty of free wall space for stickies, posters, and journey maps
    that attendees can gather around
-   Whiteboards for brainstorming (tip: use
    [*ideapaint*](https://ideapaint.com/) if physical boards aren’t
    available)
-   Equipment to project or display slides (for instructions and other
    materials)

Ensure your teams have modern hardware and software
----------------------------------------------------

Digital team members will need access to modern software and services to
do their jobs well. They will likely already be familiar with many tools
commonly used in industry and will be productive with them. The tables
later in this section include examples of popular tools, but these
aren’t exhaustive lists — ask your staff what tools they need.

“*Of public sector job seekers, 43% of 18 to 34 year olds indicated that
the government’s readiness to adopt the latest technology had a major
impact on their willingness to work in government*.” [^5]

Have a remote-first mindset
---------------------------

A geographically distributed team needs to be able to access data,
documents, and tools from anywhere.

-   Invest in decent collaboration tools
-   Work with your network and security teams to ensure tools and other
    services your team relies on can be accessed remotely

In the tables below, we’ve identified tools that facilitate remote work
as ‘remote friendly.’

### Project management and other tools

Name | Purpose | Remote Friendly
--- | --- | ---
[*Miro*](https://miro.com/)| Allows creation of product management, UX, and other types of online boards| X
[*Trello*](https://trello.com/en)| Kanban-style list making application for agile project management| X

### Collaboration tools

Communication tools are a constant barrier for government employees.
Increase productivity and foster creative, serendipitous problem solving
by procuring collaborative editing and chat software.

Name                                           | Purpose                          | Remote Friendly
--- | --- | ---
[*Slack*](https://slack.com/) or Microsoft Teams  | Real-time chat                      | X
[*Zoom*](https://zoom.us/)                        | Video conferencing                  | X

Microsoft Teams also allows for video conferencing and collaborative
document authoring in addition to real-time chat.

Checklist
---------

-   Use the list above to equip a new team with commonly used software
    and tools
-   Start procuring these as early as possible, since most large
    organizations have lengthy procedures for permitting and acquiring
    new tools and software
-   Establish a simple process for teams to request additional software
    and services

### Case study: 18F

[*18F*](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a tech team within the General Services Administration, partners with agencies to help them build and buy technology that improves the user experience of government services. With team members all over the country, 18F employs a number of strategies to [*make their “remote first” mindset work*](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/):

-   They use modern collaboration tools, shared cloud storage, and collaborative document editing to make it easy for remote teams to chat, meet, share work, and preserve decisions.
-   They require each team member to be at their own computer during meetings to ensure that remote team members have a voice equal to that of those in the office.
-   They adjust work hours to provide enough overlap between employees in different timezones. Staggered hours across time zones allows the teams to spend 12 hours per day delivering client value, and everyone is online working between 12pm and 5pm EST.
