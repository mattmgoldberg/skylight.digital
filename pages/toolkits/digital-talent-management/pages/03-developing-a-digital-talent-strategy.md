Developing a digital talent strategy
====================================

After you understand your talent gaps and established goals and metrics, it’s time to develop a digital talent strategy. A comprehensive digital talent strategy will combine the following approaches:

* Recruiting new digital talent
* Recognizing and training existing technology talent
* Preparing government employees to work collaboratively with technical teams
* Leveraging alternative sources of talent
* Using technology to create additional capacity

Recruiting new digital talent
-----------------------------

Modernizing the skills of current technical workers in government is necessary, but it will take time and effort. To improve services today, you need to recruit and hire new digital talent into government. Hiring today means you will be able to leverage the fresh perspectives and new tools and technologies without delay.

This handbook covers: what skills to hire for and [*how to recruit*](#recruiting), [*hire*](#hiring), and [*onboard*](#onboarding) new digital talent.

### Consider hiring for shorter durations

Governments tend to hire people as permanent employees. Hiring happens infrequently and is difficult because you are potentially employing someone for decades.

USDS, 18F, and CFPB have used fellowship mechanisms and special hiring authorities to hire digital talent into government for ‘tours of duty’ that can last a maximum of four years. The mechanism you use will depend on the hiring authorities available to you.

### Attracting talent to bright spots

It is easier to attract digital talent to come work for the government if they know they are joining a team. Hire digital talent into teams, creating bright spots of talent. This team should have the organizational support necessary to succeed -- be open and public about that support.

There a few different ways to create bright spots:

* **Centralized innovation hubs —** 18F (see: [*collaboration approaches to see your project succeed*](https://18f.gsa.gov/partnership-principles/)) and USDS are centralized innovation hubs. Teams work on projects for different agencies. One of the benefits of this approach is that it opens the door for teams to work on problems that span multiple agencies.[^1] It also allows for shared solutions, resulting in economies of scale.
* **Innovation teams within a single agency —** These teams are part of the agency and share the mission and values. The teams can form around critical services, providing long-term support. They can build the strong, lasting relationships and trust needed to effect change.

Recognizing and training existing technology talent
---------------------------------------------------

"*It’s common that there are dozens or even hundreds of civil servants who both know how the system works inside and out and have been trying to change it to improve outcomes for years. While it’s likely that building a delivery-driven government will require hiring new talent, failing to recognize, elevate, and support the champions you already
have (and who have the battle scars) as a new generation of leaders can set a change agenda back years, even decades.*" — *Jennifer Pahlka* [^2]

### Find people to guide new technology teams

New teams of digital talent will need to deliberately focus on building partnerships and mutual respect with existing government employees, while simultaneously learning how to navigate the bureaucracy. To accelerate this process, embed seasoned government employees into these new teams.

Find people in technology roles who are willing to guide and work with a new team while learning new methods. Recruit these folks from across government and bring them into your agency (use temporary assignments if you need to). Finding people that are the right cultural fit is important. Identify capable people who have been frustrated with the inability to get things done in their current roles, and give them a platform to shine. They will turn into your best agents of change.

Plan to send them to formal training for agile, human centered design, DevOps, and other skills as needed. They will learn on the job as well, but the investment in formal training will make this easier.

Embedding these folks in existing teams makes this easier.

* Preparing government employees to work collaboratively with technical teams

Preparing government employees to work collaboratively with technical teams
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All government employees — including those outside of your technology team — will need training and support to help them work collaboratively on technology projects. At a minimum, they will need to understand the basics of agile project management, product management, and human-centered design.

Plan to offer incentives and opportunities for continuously training your staff. Your staff needs to keep up with the pace of change in technology. The section on “Keeping skills and ideas fresh” discusses how to do this in detail.

Leveraging alternative sources of talent
----------------------------------------

Hiring people is not the only way to access digital talent. Consider some alternatives to increase the digital talent density on your team:

* Partner with universities to **offer internships**. Government offers the ability for students to make an impact.
* Support and partner with **technology boot camps** such as General Assembly, or programs like Coding IT Forward, to hire recent graduates.
* Partner with **organizations like Code For America**.
* Bring in **freelancers** on short duration temporary assignments to solve a particular problem. This can work well for tasks that don’t need to be done frequently, such as setting up DevOps pipelines or uncovering security bugs.

These alternative options for talent work best when projects are well defined.

Using technology to create additional capacity
----------------------------------------------

Government agencies are increasingly asked to do more with less — smaller budgets, fewer staff. Many government organizations are used to thinking of technology as a cost center rather than a mission enabler. But the right technology can increase efficiency, helping to augment or
replace some government jobs.

Although machine learning and artificial intelligence are often touted as necessary automation tools, they are difficult to implement well in environments that aren’t ready for modern technology. Luckily, there are often simpler alternatives to many labor intensive tasks:

* **Self-service, web-based tools** for common tasks like password resets and data edits
* **Software as a Service (SaaS) tools** — like Google Suite or Office 265 for collaboration — instead of hosting your own tools
* **Cloud-based hosting** instead of state-hosted data centers for compute and storage infrastructure
* **Web-based forms** (when forms are necessary) to replace mailing paper back and forth

Digital teams are well-suited to looking at entire processes end to end to determine where technology can add value.

Checklist
---------
* Create a comprehensive digital talent strategy
* Use technology to create additional capacity

### Case study: UK Government Digital Service

  The UK Government Digital Service (GDS) is the oldest of the civic digital service teams. In many ways, it set the standards for teams in the United States, including 18F and USDS. GDS operates on a mixed model, hiring people into a centralized team, providing oversight for new IT acquisition, and staffing teams within agencies. Through this model, they have brought hundreds of technologists into the UK government.

  The centralized team focuses on setting standards and building shared tools. For example, it’s responsible for the [*Gov.UK design system*](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/?_ga=2.48215079.183259153.1574016435-578254373.1574016435) that standardizes the look, feel, and interaction for UK government websites, as well as for shared services like [*Verify*](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify), an online identity management system.

  GDS sets the standards for hiring and helps hire a variety of technologists into the UK government. These designers, engineers, product managers, and other technologists are placed within agencies and work with other government staff to design and build vital public services.

  Another key to the GDS strategy for success is budget. GDS must approve any IT acquisition over £5 million. This helps ensure that large technology projects follow best practices. Each of these projects:
  * Is user-centered
  * Is cloud-hosted
  * Adheres to the UK design systems
  * Uses a single voice to communicate to the public
