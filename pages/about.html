            Skylight was launched in June of 2017. We're currently made up of 38 people and
            one ferret. A lot of us originally worked for civic-oriented groups such as 18F,
            the U.S. Digital Service, and the Presidential Innovation Fellows.
            Now, as part of Skylight, we're working hard to cultivate an incredible
            team and culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            What brings us together is a passion for creating better outcomes for
            the public through great government digital services. We're basically impact junkies.
            But we're also engineers, developers, designers, product managers, consultants,
            writers, speakers, inventors, roboticists, gamers, authors, veterans,
            entrepreneurs, parents, and more. Such a diverse team always gives us a
            unique perspective on things.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our official headquarters is in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chapel+Hill,+NC/@35.9209387,-79.109331,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89acc31c216e7ea7:0x7f03bae00443e4cb!8m2!3d35.9131996!4d-79.0558445">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a>,
            but we're a distributed and remote-friendly team currently spread across 20 different states.
            Sometimes the nature of our client work calls for closer proximity to their location.
            So far, we've worked with clients located in places like Washington DC, Hartford (Connecticut),
            Montgomery (Alabama), Baltimore (Maryland), and Ottawa (Canada).
          </p>

          <p>
            We're also certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as a <a href="https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs/hubzone-program">
            Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone)</a> company. This special SBA designation
            means we're committed to revitalizing local communities through job creation.
            In turn, we're granted privileged access to federal government contract opportunities,
            including up to $4M per contract award.
